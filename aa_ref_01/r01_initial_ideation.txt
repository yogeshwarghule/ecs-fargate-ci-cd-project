Purpose: raw ideas , doubts, random thoughts 

Goal: Provision full multi-environment infra on AWS using Terraform.

We will have 1 VPCs — Production.

Prod: ECS cluster for production workloads, ALBs (external).

Need to handle:
- CI/CD pipeline using github action 
Using GitHub Actions (preferred):
CI must:
• Build + test
• Build container image
• Push image to ECR 
CD must: Deploy updated image to ECS
Use rolling or blue-green deployment


- Centralized monitoring one CloudWatch dashboard 
CloudWatch metrics (CPU, memory, error count)
Two alerts: high CPU/memory, health check failures

- security 
Security Expectations
Demonstrate:
• IAM least-privilege
• Secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager or SSM
• No credentials in repo
• HTTPS enforcement explanation

Documentation (1–2 pages)
README must include:
• Simple architecture diagram
• CI/CD workflow explanation
• Deployment steps
• Monitoring & alert design
• Security considerations

Maybe later:
- Add WAF, CloudFront
- Add ECR registry & Secrets Manager rotation
- vpn
