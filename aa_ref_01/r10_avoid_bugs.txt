implementation 3
Purpose: recurring bug patterns.
Translate mistakes into prevent rules.
Quick reminder before next project.


- Never reuse subnet IDs between layers.
- Always define SG references through outputs, not locals.
- Peering routes must be added both ways.
- Use depends_on for cross-module SG or DB dependencies.
- Always use SSM Parameter Store for DB password, never TF vars.
