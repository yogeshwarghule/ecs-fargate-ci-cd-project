specification 2
purpose: Refined and detailed PRD.
Include inputs, outputs, edge cases.
Convert ideas into actionable plan.
Everything here must be testable.


ENVIRONMENTS: prod
REGION: ap-south-1

INPUTS:
- vpc_cidrs = ["10.10.0.0/16", "10.20.0.0/16", "10.30.0.0/16"]
- cluster_type = "ECS Fargate"
- image_repo = ECR (per env)
- github_repo = 

OUTPUTS:
- vpn_public_ip
- ecs_service_urls (prod)
- rds_endpoints (prod)

NON-FUNCTIONAL:
- Private subnets for ECS 
- TLS 1.2+, ACM-managed certs

TECH STACK and PORTS:
- Nodejs application
- APPLICATION RUNNING ON PORT 


APPLICATION AND THEIR DEPENDENCIES:
We have very small Node.js API (Express/Fastify — anything is fine).
The API must expose two HTTP routes:
GET /health → returns a simple status JSON.
GET /predict → returns a fixed JSON { "score": 0.75 }.
No database, no business logic, no external integration — just static responses.
The purpose is to see your ability to containerize, deploy, and automate CI/CD, not to build complex backend logic.
They want you to show clean code, Dockerfile, infra, and deployment, not a fancy API.
